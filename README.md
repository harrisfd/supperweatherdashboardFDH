# supperweatherdashboardFDH
As a traveler, they want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so they can plan a trip accordingly. 
A weather dashboard was created with form inputs so when a traveler searches for a city, they are presented current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.  When they view the current weather conditions for that city, they are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. 
The UV index is presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. The future view of the weather conditions for that city is also displayed. Included in the dashboard is a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity. A search history of the city is available when the traveler clicks that city, which will show again the current and future conditions for that city.
